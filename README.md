# odin-recipes

Hello this is my first attempt at building a website following what i have learnt following the odin curriculum thus far

I will showcase everything i learnt thus far from HTML and try to include some elements that i have studied on my own that have not yet been covered.

I hope I will be able to do this sucessfully as it will be one of the first projects I will make
